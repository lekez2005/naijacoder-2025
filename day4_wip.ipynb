    "## Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It's particularly useful for problems that can be divided into similar sub-problems. Hereâ€™s an introduction to recursion in Python, including basic concepts, examples, and key considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursive function stops calling itself. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments, working towards the base case."
